# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Layout

An npm workspace of four packages, plus a Ruby gem beside them. Root scripts fan out across the npm
packages; per-package scripts do one package's work.

|                        |                                        |                                                                         |
| ---------------------- | -------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `packages/tokens`      | `@cruglobal/cornerstone-design-system` | the design tokens — published, public                                   |
| `packages/components`  | `@cruglobal/cornerstone-components`    | the component library — published, public                               |
| `packages/docs`        | —                                      | the Astro documentation site — deploys to GitHub Pages, never published |
| `packages/build-tools` | —                                      | modules the library and the docs share — private, never published       |
| `packages/rails`       | `cornerstone-rails` (Ruby gem)         | Rails engine serving the component library — not an npm package         |

Paths in this file are relative to `packages/tokens` unless stated otherwise.

## Commands

```sh
# whole workspace
npm run build          # build every package (slow — includes the component library)
npm run verify         # every package's own gate; the component suite is ~35 minutes
npx changeset          # interactively add a changeset before merging a PR
npx changeset status   # preview what the next version bump would be

# one package
npm run validate --workspace @cruglobal/cornerstone-design-system   # lint the token tree
npm run build    --workspace @cruglobal/cornerstone-design-system   # tokens → build/ via Style Dictionary
npm run verify   --workspace @cruglobal/cornerstone-components      # the library's full gate
npm run build    --workspace cornerstone-docs-site                  # the documentation site
```

`packages/tokens/build/`, `packages/components/dist/` and `packages/docs/dist/` are all gitignored.
Built artifacts live only in the published packages and the deployed site.

`packages/components` has its own `CLAUDE.md`; read it before working in there.

## Token Architecture

Tokens are organized in three layers with strict aliasing rules enforced by `npm run validate`:

```
tokens/
  ref.json          # _ref.*  — raw primitives (hex colors, unitless numbers, font strings)
  sys/
    cru-light.json  # _sys.*  — semantic aliases per brand × theme mode
    cru-dark.json
    fl-light.json
    fl-dark.json
  cmp/
    *.json          # _cmp.*  — component-level aliases
```

**Aliasing rules (validated, not just convention):**

- `_sys` tokens must alias `_ref` tokens only
- `_cmp` tokens must alias `_sys` tokens only (direct `_ref` aliases produce a warning; `_cmp`→`_cmp` is an error)
- Raw color literals are only allowed in `_ref`

All files use [W3C DTCG](https://design-tokens.github.io/community-group/format/) format (`$type` / `$value`).

## Build Pipeline

`packages/tokens/build.mjs` runs Style Dictionary 5.x (`usesDtcg: true`) across five platform sets:

| Input                             | CSS selector                             |
| --------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------- |
| `packages/tokens/tokens/ref.json` | `:root`                                  |
| `tokens/sys/cru-light.json`       | `[data-brand="cru"][data-theme="light"]` |
| `tokens/sys/cru-dark.json`        | `[data-brand="cru"][data-theme="dark"]`  |
| `tokens/sys/fl-light.json`        | `[data-brand="fl"][data-theme="light"]`  |
| `tokens/sys/fl-dark.json`         | `[data-brand="fl"][data-theme="dark"]`   |

Each set outputs CSS variables, SCSS variables, ESM, CJS, TypeScript declarations, and nested/flat JSON under `build/`.

Two custom transforms are registered in `packages/tokens/build.mjs`: `name/css/cornerstone` (strips leading `_` from path segments and joins with `-`) and `value/number/unit` (applies `px`, opacity ratio, or `em` based on the token path).

## Changeset Rules

Every PR that touches the token API needs a changeset:

- **major** — removing or renaming a `_sys` or `_cmp` token
- **minor** — adding a new token, mode, or component
- **patch** — changing a value (color tweak, alias retarget that keeps the public name)

PRs that only change scripts/tooling with no token API impact still take a real bump and a real
description — never `npx changeset add --empty`.

**Keep the description to the change, not the reasoning behind it.** A changeset body is copied verbatim
into `CHANGELOG.md`, which npm, GitHub and the docs changelog all render, so an essay here is an essay on
three surfaces. A line or two, or a short bullet list; the rationale belongs in the PR description, which
every changelog entry links to. The first four entries reached 74-519 words each and had to be rewritten.

**The pull request description carries the reasoning, and enough of it to stand alone.** A reviewer should
be able to judge the change without opening the diff: what moved, what was considered and rejected, and what
was verified. Every changelog entry links to its pull request, so this is also where a reader lands when the
one-line summary is not enough — the two are a pair, and the brevity above only works because the depth is
here.

**Lead the summary with its category** — `Fixed:`, `Added:`, `Changed:`, `Removed:`, `Breaking:` or
`Deprecated:`. A changeset records the bump it causes, and a bump level is not a category: `patch` covers a
bug fix, a chore and a tooling tweak alike. The prefix is what lets the docs changelog give a generated entry
the same bullet icon an authored one gets; it reads as ordinary prose in the `CHANGELOG.md` npm and GitHub
render, and `remark-changelog.js` strips it there. An entry without one still publishes fine — it just keeps
a plain bullet rather than being guessed at.

Both packages release through changesets; `.changeset/config.json` ignores neither. The documentation
site is not published, but its pages are compiled into the agent skills the component library ships, so a
change under `packages/docs/src/content/docs/` changes `@cruglobal/cornerstone-components`' output and
takes a bump like any other.

## Release Flow

Merging to `main` triggers `release.yml`. `changesets/action` will:

1. While changesets are pending → open/update a **"chore: version packages"** PR
2. When that PR is merged → publish to npm with provenance via npm Trusted Publishing (no `NPM_TOKEN` needed; `id-token: write` permission is already configured)

Trusted publishing is configured **per package** on npmjs.com, and npm only lets you configure it for a
package that already exists — so a package's very first version has to be published by hand before OIDC
can take over. `@cruglobal/cornerstone-design-system` did that from CI with a short-lived `NPM_TOKEN`
(added in `ca23090`, removed in `900ea4e`); `@cruglobal/cornerstone-components` did it from a maintainer's
machine, answering an interactive 2FA challenge. Prefer the second for the next one: it creates no standing
credential, and npm removes direct publishing from bypass-2FA tokens in January 2027, leaving OIDC and
staged publishing.

Provenance is declared in exactly one place: `packages/tokens`' own `publishConfig`. Trusted publishing
attaches an attestation by itself — the flag exists to turn that _off_ — while setting it true makes
`npm publish` refuse to run anywhere but a CI runner, which is precisely what a first publish cannot be.
A root `.npmrc` carrying `provenance=true` used to apply that to every package in the workspace, and it is
what failed `@cruglobal/cornerstone-components`' bootstrap publish with `Automatic provenance generation
not supported for provider: null`. It bought nothing OIDC was not already doing, so it is gone. The flag
survives only in the tokens manifest, where it reaches one package that publishes from CI and nowhere else.

Neither package runs its test suite at publish time. `prepublishOnly` is `npm run build` in both, because
the release runner installs no browsers — `npm run verify` in `packages/components` ends in a
three-engine Playwright run that would fail there, and CI has already run that exact gate on the commit
being released.

## Syncing Tokens from Figma

Use the `/pull-tokens` slash command (requires the Figma plugin for Claude Code — install via `/plugins`). It change-detects via per-subtree FNV-1a hashes and only re-pulls what changed. See `.claude/commands/pull-tokens.md` for the full protocol.

**Known limitation:** The `use_figma` tool has a ~20 KB response budget. When multiple `sys/color/<mode>` subtrees change simultaneously, extract them one mode at a time to avoid silent truncation (see issue #23).

## Documentation Site

`packages/docs` is an Astro/Starlight site published to GitHub Pages at
https://cruglobal.github.io/cornerstone-design-system/ by `.github/workflows/pages.yml`, which runs on
push to `main`. Pages is configured in Terraform (`cru-terraform`, `github/CruGlobal/repos/cornerstone-design-system`)
with `build_type = "workflow"` — not a branch source, which would run Jekyll and drop Astro's `_astro/`
directory.

Every documentation URL derives from `packages/components/package.json`'s `homepage`, by way of
`packages/build-tools/site-url.js`. Change it there, nowhere else; `scripts/check-docs-url.js` fails the
build if a literal address appears anywhere.

## Agent skills

Paths in this section are relative to the repo root, not `packages/tokens`.

### Issue tracker

Issues live in this repo's GitHub Issues, reached through the `gh` CLI — including wayfinder maps and their
child tickets. See `docs/agents/issue-tracker.md`.

### Triage labels

The five canonical triage roles, each label string equal to its own name. See `docs/agents/triage-labels.md`.

### Domain docs

Multi-context: a root `CONTEXT-MAP.md` points at one `CONTEXT.md` per package, with root-level `docs/adr/` for
decisions no single package owns. See `docs/agents/domain.md`.
